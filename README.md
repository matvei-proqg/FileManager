# File Manager
![File Manager Icon](/FileManager.png)

File Manager will be the default Files app for AuruOS

Like most of the other default applications it is written in C++

At the moment it is a very basic Files app,

We will continue to add more to it.

# Install
File Manager will be available pre-installed on AuruOS, but until then you can install it here!

Firstly, get the code by opening a terminal and typing 
```

I have included an `install.sh` script

Navigate to the code with:

```
cd File-Manager
```

run it as root by entering the following command:

```
sudo bash install.sh
```

# Running

There are 3 ways to run the application.

1. Run the File Manager application from the terminal. After installing make sure you are still in the `File-Manager` directory and type 
```
./Files
```

2. Run the File Manager application from the applications menu.

3. Run the File Manager application by clicking the icon on the dekstop. 
``
Note: If it is your first time running the application from the desktop icon, It will appear greyed-out. Before launching you must right-click and select ALLOW LAUNCHING
